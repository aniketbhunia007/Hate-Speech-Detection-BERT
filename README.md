## Hate Speech Detection
* American Express Ignite Project 2019
* Pranav D. Pawar ; Mentor : Lokesh Kumar Kriplani

Detailed documentation and experiments details - [here](./hate_sppech_doc.pdf)

### Flask Web App
* Primary features of API - 
  * Custom Text Input testing - Given a text input, we can generate the probability of hate speech with an F1-Score of 94% (using BERT model)
  * Hashtag analysis - 
    * Given a valid hashtag, API scrapes the latest n tweets for that hashtag and performs an evaluation on it using our deployed model. 
    * Finally generates a sorted list of tweets according to their hate probability.
    * Here the input is a hashtag, no. of tweets, and date since you want to perform the evaluation upon
  * User analysis
    * Given a valid twitter user ID, API scrapes the latest n tweets on the userâ€™s timeline and similar to the previous case generates a table of a sorted list of tweets according to their hate probability.
    * Here the input is only the hashtag and no. of tweets to scrape

* BERT App Service
